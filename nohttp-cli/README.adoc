This is a utility for finding and replacing http URLs using https://github.com/spring-io/nohttp/tree/main/nohttp[nohttp].
It takes into account which URLs are allowed by nohttp.

= Usage

The application is an executable jar application.
The application requires JDK 8+ to compile and run.

== Downloading

- Snapshots are available for download at https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot/io/spring/nohttp/nohttp-cli/
- Releases are available for download at https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/spring/nohttp/nohttp-cli/

Once you download, we recommend exporting the jar to a variable named `NOHTTP`.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
export NOHTTP='~/Downloads/nohttp-cli-0.0.10.jar'
----

== Compiling

To use this app first create the jar

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :nohttp-cli:assemble
----

The jar will now available at `nohttp-cli/build/libs/nohttp-cli-0.0.11-SNAPSHOT`.

You can then export the full path to a variable.

[source,bash]
----
export NOHTTP=$(pwd)/nohttp-cli/build/libs/nohttp-cli-0.0.11-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

The guide assumes that the jar is now available in the variable `$NOHTTP`.
If that is not true, you can substitute `$NOHTTP` for the absolute path of `nohttp-cli-0.0.11-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

== Running

It is best to run this in a folder that does not have any files with build output.
If you use git, a great way to ensure that there are no build output is to do a fresh clone.
Alternatively, you can remove all files not added to git using `git clean -dfx`.
Keep in mind this may delete things you want (i.e. IDE related files).

=== Hello nohttp

The easiest approach is to run the application with no arguments.
This will attempt to find http in all text based files in the current directory while ignoring `.git` folder.

[NOTE]
====
The process for checking if it is a text file uses a native invocation of `grep`.
If you cannot run `grep`, then you can disable text using `-T` flag shown in <<help,Help>>.

Usage: nohttp [-fhMrsTV] [-w=<allowlistFile>] [-D=<regex>]... [-F=<regex>]...
              [<dir>]
      [<dir>]           The directory to scan. Default is current working directory.
  -D=<regex>            Regular expression of directories to exclude scanning.
                          Specify multiple times to provide multiple exclusions.
                          Default is to exclude .git
  -f                    If true, prints out the file names.
  -F=<regex>            Regular expression of files to exclude scanning. Specify
                          multiple times to provide multiple exclusions. Default is
                          no file exclusions.
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -M                    Disables printing each match within their specific files.
  -r                    Enables replacing the values that were found. The default is
                          to just find the results.
  -s                    Enables checking the http status before determining if
                          replacement should be done.
  -T                    Disable searching only text based files. This is determined
                          using native invocation of grep which will not work on all
                          systems, so it can be disabled.
  -V, --version         Print version information and exit.
  -w=<allowlistFile>    The path to file that contains additional allowlist of
                          allowed URLs. The format is a regular expression to
                          allowlist (ignore http URLs) per line.
